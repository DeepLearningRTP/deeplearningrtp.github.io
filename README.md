## Learning Resources

Recent history of deep learning from the fantastic podcast [Talking Machines](url=http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/)
- History of Deep Learning from the Inside Out - [Part 1](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/2/26/the-history-of-machine-learning-from-the-inside-out) and [Part 2](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/3/13/how-machine-learning-got-where-it-is-and-the-future-of-the-field)

#### Resources we've used in this study group:
- Start with [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/) from [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai)
- or [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) from Andrew Ng
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) from Michael Nielsen
- [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) by Aurelien Geron

#### Courses worth looking into:
- [Deep Natural Language Processing from Oxford](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures) 
- [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Image Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/)
- [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra) from fast.ai
- [Machine Learning for Artists](https://ml4a.github.io/)

#### Down the Deep Rabbit Hole
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction.](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
- [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

#### To Infinity and Beyond:
As the number of deep learning tutorials and lists of lists approaches infinity, here are some good places to browse -
- [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning)
- and [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)

#### Our projects so far (July 16, 2017):
- [Tensorflow talks](https://github.com/apiltamang/tensorflow_rtp_materials)
- [Apil speaks](https://youtu.be/R13oMsL_7hY) at PyData
- DonkeyCar!
- [Triangle Computer Vision and Image Processing Group](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing-Group/)
