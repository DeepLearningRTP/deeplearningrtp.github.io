## Learning Resources

Recent history of deep learning from the fantastic podcast [Talking Machines](url=http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/)
History of Deep Learning from the Inside Out - [Part 1](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/2/26/the-history-of-machine-learning-from-the-inside-out) and [Part 2](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/3/13/how-machine-learning-got-where-it-is-and-the-future-of-the-field)

#### Resources we've used in this study group:
- Start with [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/) from [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai)
- or (deeplearning.ai)[https://www.deeplearning.ai/] from Andrew Ng
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://course.fast.ai/) from Michael Nielsen
- [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) by Aurelien Geron

#### Courses worth looking into:
- [Deep Natural Language Processing from Oxford](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures) 
- [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Image Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/)
- [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra) from fast.ai
- [Machine Learning for Artists](https://ml4a.github.io/)

#### Our projects so far (July 16, 2017):
- [Tensorflow talks](https://github.com/apiltamang/tensorflow_rtp_materials)
- [Apil speaks](https://youtu.be/R13oMsL_7hY)at PyData
- DonkeyCar!

#### To Infinity and Beyond:
As the number of deep learning tutorials and lists of lists approaches infinity, here are some good places to browse -
- [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning)
- [A Guide to Deep Learning](http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/)
- and [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DeepLearningRTP/deeplearningrtp.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DeepLearningRTP/deeplearningrtp.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
